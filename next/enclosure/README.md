# Shmøergh Moduleur Enclosure

We made an enclosure design to house all the components in one single box. This is a highly technological solution that is not really suited for DIY we'll just share the enclosure top, so you can design your own box and use the holes and labels that perfectly line up. We'll also share a 3D STEP file so you can just print a top plate on your 3D printer. (well, if you have a pretty big one)

The enclosure was designed in OnShape and you can just use OnShape to copy and edit if you'd like. [OnShape Link](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/9d6c9c68a853f8e66f1137da/w/ce10bd0a67826e1d42122627/e/09bb41061e596c896e897ed1?renderMode=0&uiState=6935dd5b243446fa8660a6cd)
