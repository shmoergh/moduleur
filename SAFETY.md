# Moduleur – Safety & Intended Use Notice

## Intended Use

The Moduleur is an open-source, DIY modular synthesizer system intended for:

- experienced electronics builders,
- low-voltage electronic experimentation,
- sound synthesis and music production,
- operation in dry, indoor environments.

This repository provides design files, documentation, and build guidance for self-assembly.

The Moduleur is **not a consumer appliance** and is **not a finished commercial product** when built by third parties.

---

## Electrical Safety

The Moduleur is designed to operate exclusively from:

- an external SELV-rated DC power adapter
- recommended: 12V DC, center-positive
- supported input range: 9–36V DC

The device must **never** be connected directly to mains voltage.

Improper power supplies, reversed polarity, incorrect wiring, or modifications may result in:

- equipment damage
- fire hazard
- risk of personal injury

Always verify polarity and voltage before powering the device.
