# Shmøergh Moduleur / DIY Enclosure

We made an enclosure design to house all the components in one single box and allow for attachments. The original version is built from aluminum with powder coated panel design. We acknowledge this is quite a barrier for many DIYers so we designed the same enclosure using parts that can be easily ordered and/or built at home.
