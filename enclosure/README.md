# Shmøergh Moduleur Enclosure

We made an enclosure design to house all the components in one single box and allow for attachments, hacks. This is a highly technological solution that is not really suited for DIY so we'll also share the enclosure top separately, so you can design your own box and use the holes and labels that perfectly line up. We'll also share a 3D STEP file so you can just print a top panel on your 3D printer. (well, if you have a pretty big one)

## Full Moduleur Enclosure - WIP

<img src="https://github.com/shmoergh/moduleur/blob/main/enclosure/enclosure-full.jpg?raw=true" />

The full enclosure is a combination of custom and ready-made parts. It is built around two Bosch 10x40 aluminum t-slot rails with four aluminum plates and a bunch of plastic fixtures and steel/brass screws and nuts. This allows for a rigid and extendable structure.

The full enclosure consists of the following parts:
### Metal plates
- 1  - Top Panel - 256x320mm
- 1  - Side Panel - 40x320mm
- 1  - Side Panel with holes for the Brain module’s USB connectors - 40x320mm
- 1  - Bottom Panel - 256x320mm
### 3D printed fixtures
- 2  - Corner fixtures - right
- 2  - Corner fixtures - left
- 2  - Side fixtures
### Rails
- 2  - Bosch Strut Profiles 10x40 - 253mm (We recommend to get them cut to length by the supplier)
- 4  - Bosch Slot6 M4 nuts (We recommend ordering more than you need to experiment with accessories)
### Screws
- 14 - M4 hex socket screws - 10mm
- 50 - M3 hex socket screws - 8mm
- 4  - Rubber feet with M3 screws
- 2  - M4 hex nuts - 7mm side-to-side
- 4  - M3 square nuts - 5x5mm
- 4  - M3 female threaded hex spacers (standoffs) - 10mm, 4.6mm side-to-side
- 5  - M3 female threaded hex spacers (standoffs) - 40mm, 4.6mm side-to-side


## Files, Links

The entire enclosure was designed in OnShape and you can just use OnShape to copy and edit if you'd like. (Link TBD)

### Fixtures (STEP)

- [Corner fixture - left](https://github.com/shmoergh/moduleur/tree/main/enclosure/fixtures/bosch-block-left.step)
- [Side fixture](https://github.com/shmoergh/moduleur/tree/main/enclosure/fixtures/bosch-block-side.step)
### Rails
These will have alternatives and compatible/licenced versions so you don't have to buy directly from Bosch. We source these from [Motedis](https://www.motedis.com/en/Profile-40x10-B-Type-slot-6) in Europe.
- [Bosch Strut Profiles 10x40](https://store.boschrexroth.com/en/hu/p/strut-profile-3842526817) - [STEP file](https://github.com/shmoergh/moduleur/tree/main/enclosure/bosch/bosch-10X40.stp) in 253mm length for reference
- [Bosch Slot6 M4 nut](https://store.boschrexroth.com/en/hu/p/t-nut-3842536599)
### Screws
We use [DIN 912](https://boltbase.com/blog/socket-cap-screws-your-complete-guide-to-din-912/) (or ISO 4762 if that's what you can find), *hex socket, head cap* screws in different two distinct sizes:
- M4 x 0.5 x 10mm (knurled head ones look nice too)
- M3 x 0.5 x 8mm
any grade is fine, we used grade 8.8 ones (it is not necessary to use stronger for this)
you can use any finish to your liking, they are widely available in black steel, zinc-plated and stainless versions
pro-tip: go to a local screws&bolts shop and they will sort you out
### Feet
TBD
### Nuts
TBD
### Spacers

## Design-your-own-box solution - Top Panel only

<img src="https://github.com/shmoergh/moduleur/blob/main/enclosure/enclosure-top.jpg?raw=true" />

In this version you can design your own box and attach the original Moduleur top panel to it. note: There's plenty of space on the top/bottom due to the lack of the 10mm Bosch rails in this one, but the top panel only counts with sides that are only 1.5mm thick. Make sure you add to the plate if you have thicker sides (like a wooden/plastic box perhaps)
