# Shmøergh Moduleur / DIY Enclosure

We made an enclosure design to house all the components in one single box and allow for attachments. The original version is built from aluminum with powder coated panel design. We acknowledge this is quite a barrier for many DIYers so we designed the same enclosure using parts that can be easily ordered and/or built at home.

## Overview

The DIY enclosure consists of the following building blocks:

- FR4 panels (front, back, left and right sides). These panels are essentially PCBs without components, featuring silkscreen printing so you don't need to worry about labeling — you just need to order them from JLCPCB just like you would with the PCB of any other module.
- 3D printed top and bottom side blocks
- 3D printed internal parts
- Screws, nuts and spacers.

## BOM

See [enclosure-bom.csv](enclosure-bom.csv) for the complete bill of materials.

## Build guide

1. Order FR4 panels from JLCPCB (see note for Using Bosch rails)
2. Print all 3D printed parts from the BOM
3. Get all non 3D printed parts from the BOM
4. Use the above figure for assembly

## Note: Using Bosch rails

The above guide is optimized for the most commonly available components and parts. However, instead of the 3D printed top and bottom blocks you can use aluminum [Bosch rails](https://store.boschrexroth.com/en/hu/p/strut-profile-3842526817) (see BOM) which allows you to design and attach more flexible accessories (handles, stands, passive modules etc) to the Moduleur.

If you're using Bosch rails for top and bottom make sure you order the Bosch compatible FR4 side panels from this folder instead of regular ones.
