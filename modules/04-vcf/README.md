# Shmøergh Moduleur / VCF

Dual mode Eurorack compatible diode filter based on the famous Synthacon Steiner-Parker circuit.

## Features

- Classic diode filter with extremely drippy character
- Low pass and high pass filter inputs
- Fine-tunable maximum resonance control — can go smooth to crazy
- Two external CV inputs with logarithmic attenuverters
- Optional EMC shielding to isolate external noise
- Separate core and UI PCBs for reusability and custom UI builds
- Gerber files for JLCPCB order
- Designed from very common electronic components

## Boards

- [Core board](./electronics/core/) — Contains all active circuitry and handles the complete audio, CV, and logic processing for the module.
- [UI board](./electronics/ui/) — Hosts all panel-mounted controls and connectors, providing the physical interface to the module’s Core PCB.
