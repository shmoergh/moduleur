# Hog Moduleur / Default Patch

An optional passive PCB which connects the modules of the Shmøergh Moduleur. This essentially creates a default patch which makes the Moduleur playable without patch cables.

## How to Build

- Gerber files for JLCPCB ordering are in each board's `production` folder
- BOM is also available in the respective `production` folder. All THT components are available at Mouser
- Use the KiCad schematic and PCB layout for soldering reference
- **Before connecting any modules**, always make sure there are no shorts between ±12V and ground.
